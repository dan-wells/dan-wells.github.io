Fun with formatting
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>Since I never remember which way round headings go in markdown, let's have a play around.</p>


<h1>Heading 1</h1>

<p>That should be the biggest.</p>

<h2>Heading 2</h2>

<p>This is normally a subheading, but might be the size of the post title on the index page?</p>

<h3>Heading 3</h3>

<p>I remember this is something on the index page but not what...
Oh yes, this is the level used for blog post titles after all.</p>

<h4>Heading 4</h4>

<p>This is the level you would want to use for subheadings inside a blog post, it matches the left-indentation of the rest of the body text.
But do we dare dream to go smaller?</p>

<h5>Heading 5</h5>

<p>Nobody knows where we might end up, but that's already too small and squishy.</p>

<p>While we're at it, how about some other formatting?
Like a code block:</p>

<pre><code>def hello():
    print("hello world!")
</code></pre>

<p>That needs some specific CSS to display newlines as written, if you were to wrap it in triple-backticks.
Indenting by four spaces seems better for actual code blocks, because then there's no conflict with formatting inline monospace using single backticks.</p>

<p>Or a blockquote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is far too much time to spend on making up a blog.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess we can also see what the <code>blog.css</code> does with lists, cos it has some specific settings:</p>

<ul>
<li>Here is one list item</li>
<li>And another one</li>
<li>One more for good measure</li>
</ul>

<p>Wonder what the spacing at the bottom is like?</p>
