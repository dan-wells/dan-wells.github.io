</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Ed and Justine Miliband first met at a dinner party, hosted by the woman he was 'secretly' dating</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Relish the scene. A dinner party in West London. The hostess: Stephanie Flanders, the glamorous then economics editor of BBC2's Newsnight. The guests: young barristers and would-be politicians.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Central to the party that night back in March 2004 was Flanders' boyfriend, Labour rising star Ed Miliband. At the time, he was chief economics adviser to the Chancellor, Gordon Brown.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Miliband had been back in Britain for two months after a brief spell as a lecturer at Harvard University in the U.S. Ever the policy nerd, the son of a Marxist professor waxed lyrical about economic theory.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">As he held court, a young woman called Justine Thornton, who was sitting across the table and whom he had never met before, became transfixed.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A clever young environmental lawyer, she had been invited by Stephanie — the brilliant daughter of Michael Flanders, of the Fifties and Sixties musical comedy duo Flanders &amp; Swann.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Yesterday, Justine recalled in a red-top newspaper: 'I thought he was good-looking and clever and seemed to be unattached. But we just went down a conversation cul-de-sac. Apparently we had nothing in common.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'He just wanted to talk about economics — one of my least favourite subjects. None of our conversations went anywhere.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Mrs Miliband said that she was 'furious' when — far from being 'unattached' — she found out that he was 'secretly going out with' the woman who had invited her for dinner.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Fast-forward more than 11 years and the Milibands have since had two children, married and believe they are less than a month away from moving house with their family to No 10 Downing Street.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But the story of the pair's first meeting offers a fascinating insight into the somewhat caddish character of the Labour Leader.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><span class="mol-style-bold">Scroll down for video </span></font></p><div><div class="related-carousel with-fb news half"

Clearly she was guided by Labour spin doctors, who wanted to give the impression to voters that her husband was a touchy-feely human being, rather than the soulless nerd that his awkward image conveys on TV. The simpering headline of the article ran: 'Ed bandaged me up after I was bitten by a Doberman . . . and I fell in love.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Justine told how, during the 2005 election campaign, Ed had come to her rescue after she was bitten by the dog.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It happened when they were putting leaflets through letter-boxes in houses in Runcorn, Cheshire. 'Ed bandaged me and I fell in love with him,' said Justine.</font></p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"><div class="splitLeft"><div class="mol-img">  <img id="i-d3a59697e1b3691" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/04/09/22/2768D2DD00000578-0-image-a-10_1428614975470.jpg" height="455" width="306" alt="Former partners of Mr Miliband include Juliet Soskice (pictured)" class="blkBorder img-share"/>

Justine's recollection isn't, though, the first public airing of her love story with Ed.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In the biography of the Labour leader, titled Ed: The Milibands And The Making Of A Labour Leader, an associate is quoted as saying: 'Although she was struck by his eyes — wide and brown and fixed on their subject — a friend remembers her undoubted excitement after meeting Ed as: 'Gosh, how fascinating, he's really clever', rather than: 'Gosh, how handsome'.' Perhaps glossing over what may be seen as such caddish behaviour, the Daily Mirror omitted to say that the dinner's hostess, Stephanie Flanders (who later left the BBC for a £400,000-a-year job at a bank in the City), was Ed's then girlfriend.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It was left to Tony Blair's biographer John Rentoul to let the cat out of the bag after reading the Mirror story, when he tweeted: 'Justine on clandestine Ed. Why has Mirror not named the host of that dinner? It was Stephanie Flanders.'</font></p><div class="mol-img-group floatRHS">    <div class="mol-img">  <img id="i-2d4d3993d4286252" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/04/09/22/0092640300000514-0-image-m-14_1428616082199.jpg" height="673" width="306" alt="Stephanie Flanders (pictured), a former girlfriend of Mr Miliband, hosted the dinner party where he first met his future wife" class="blkBorder img-share"/>
</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Stephanie Flanders (pictured), a former girlfriend of Mr Miliband, hosted the dinner party where he first met his future wife</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Considering that she, at the time, was economics editor of BBC-TV's flagship Newsnight, Rentoul added: 'Could the secrecy have been because he was a Treasury special adviser and Stephanie Flanders was a BBC economics journalist?'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">What's more, there is another intriguing twist to this story of high politics and high economics.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">For two years ago, Ed Miliband ungallantly blurted out, during an interview with a celebrity magazine, that not only had he romanced Stephanie but that his close Labour colleague and Shadow Chancellor, Ed Balls, had had a relationship with her, too.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Miliband said: 'We did both date her but there was a long time apart between me and Ed. Stephanie and I don't have any problems running into each other now.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">For her part, Stephanie had no forewarning of Miliband's revelation and restricted her response to curtly dismissing her relationship with him as having been 'very brief and a very long time ago'.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">However, her relationship with Balls, a decade earlier, was more serious. They met in 1989 at Harvard University, where they were both Kennedy scholars after having graduated from Oxford University.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It was while they were working at the Financial Times as leader writers that their friendship blossomed into a serious relationship.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The way these relationships intertwined also highlights the deeply incestuous and narrow world of the Labour high command. For it wasn't just Miliband and Balls, but others, too, who had close personal relationships.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Of course, Balls is now married to fellow Shadow Cabinet Minister Yvette Cooper. All four studied Politics, Philosophy and Economics (PPE) at Oxford University.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Cooper and Flanders were tutorial partners and Kennedy scholars at Harvard. Miliband also studied at Harvard.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Cooper once shared a house with Miliband (who apparently had a few other girlfriends). And she met Balls when they both worked at the FT.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But back to Ed Miliband's tangled love-life. For several years in the mid-1990s, when he was working as an adviser to the then-Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown, he went out with fellow political aide, Liz Lloyd (a Cambridge graduate).</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">She worked for a time for Tony Blair, who described her in his memoirs as 'an English rose, intellectually able and blue stocking or red stocking according to the occasion'.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In the summer of 1995, she and Miliband went on holiday to the south of France. They stayed in the family home of one of Miliband's first girlfriends, Juliet Soskice (the daughter of an LSE political economist and who went on to marry the late tycoon Andrew Rosenfeld, who gave £1 million to the Labour Party).</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">At the time, Juliet was dating the Blairite journalist Phil Collins (who went on to write speeches for Blair). It was clearly a busman's holiday, as much of the discussion among the group was about the national minimum wage which was a New Labour policy.</font></p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group">    <div class="mol-img">  <img id="i-ef85302fe249b102" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/04/09/22/2769291600000578-0-image-a-11_1428614983783.jpg" height="687" width="634" alt="After breaking up with Liz Lloyd, Mr Miliband had a brief relationship with the journalist Alice Miles (pictured)" class="blkBorder img-share"/>
</div>    <p class="imageCaption">After breaking up with Liz Lloyd, Mr Miliband had a brief relationship with the journalist Alice Miles (pictured)</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'We discussed it like we were in a Fabian Society seminar,' recalled Collins. 'I remember being in the kitchen and listening to Ed having a conversation about it in real detail.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Miliband's relationship with Lloyd continued when Blair became PM. Her job at No 10 meant she sat next to her lover's elder brother David Miliband, who was a key figure in the Downing Street policy unit.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">After breaking up with Lloyd, Ed Miliband had a brief relationship with the journalist Alice Miles, who then worked for The Times. Ms Miles, who some years later became a single parent, also had a fling with her then coke-snorting Times colleague Tom Baldwin, who is now Miliband's chief spin doctor.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">What a deliciously small and privileged world! One that is a million miles from the lives of millions of ordinary voters.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And so back to Red Ed and Justine.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The next time they met after his questionable behaviour at his then girlfriend Stephanie Flanders' dinner party was in the months leading up to him becoming an MP. Later, she helped campaign for him in Doncaster during the 2005 election by moving chairs around for a public meeting.</font></p><div class="mol-img-group floatRHS">    <div class="mol-img">  <img id="i-287b950d69db94d6" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/04/09/23/27698AC700000578-3032823-image-m-4_1428617167960.jpg" height="203" width="306" alt="No more Mr Nerd: Justine's interview in yesterday's Labour-supporting Mirror" class="blkBorder img-share"/>
</div>    <p class="imageCaption">No more Mr Nerd: Justine's interview in yesterday's Labour-supporting Mirror</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Some months after, Justine planned a holiday with a woman barrister friend, Quincy Whitaker, to Libya to see the Roman ruins. However, after it was booked, Justine said she wanted to go, instead, with Ed Miliband.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Their relationship had consolidated further by the time Miliband was appointed Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change in the Brown government. Not only had their personal lives meshed, but their professional ones, too, as Justine (who was a member of the Labour Party) had written a book on the environment.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A few years later they had the first of their two children — and then decided to get married (in May 2011).</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">This week, by happily putting the spotlight on her husband's past love affairs, Justine must be hoping that the result will be to portray him as a dashing romantic figure.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">However, many voters — particularly women — may see him in a less attractive light.</font></p><div class="moduleFull mol-video"><a name="video" class="namedLink" href=""></a><div class="item">
